# Professional Industrial Website Update (Image-Light)

## Image Usage
- Limit: 3–4 total images
- Currently used: **1 hero image** (already integrated)
- Optional slots (if desired later): Industries, Quality, Product (flow control)
- All other sections are text-only and do not require images

See `NANOBANANA_PROMPTS.md` for the 4 prompts.

## Design Notes
- Dark industrial theme, blue accents (#3b82f6), bold typography
- Responsive, high contrast, smooth hover and focus states
- Sections remain comprehensive but image placeholders removed to reduce asset needs

## Next Steps
1) If you want any of the optional images, generate up to 3 more using the prompts and add with Next.js `<Image>`.
2) Otherwise, no further images are needed—the site is production ready as text-first.
